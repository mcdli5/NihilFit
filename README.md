# Nihil Fit

*Ex nihilo nihil fit* - "Nothing comes from nothing"

Releases are available on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nihilfit).  
Issues should be reported to the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/mcdli5/NihilFit/issues).

Do you love Skyblocks? Do you hate not having the resources to do as you please? Then this is the mod for you!

Nihil Fit is inspired by Ex Nihilo Creatio for 1.12, a fork of Ex Nihilo Adscensio for 1.10. Ex Nihilo Adscensio was a continuation of the Ex Nihilo mod from 1.7.10, rewritten from the ground up.

We aim to mantain the same core concepts, but with a few twists if necessary.
