# Nihil Fit: Ex Nihilo

*Ex nihilo nihil fit* - "Nothing comes from nothing"

Releases are available on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nihilfit).  
Issues should be reported to the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/mcdli5/NihilFit/issues).

Do you love Skyblocks? Do you hate not having the resources to do as you please? Then this is the mod for you!

Nihil Fit is inspired by Ex Nihilo Creatio for 1.12, a fork of Ex Nihilo Adscensio for 1.10. Ex Nihilo Adscensio was
a continuation of the Ex Nihilo mod from 1.7.10, rewritten from the ground up.

We aim to mantain the same core concepts, but with a few twists if necessary.

## TODO / DONE -- Check the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):
The following will be included in this mod. More to follow once this is complete.
- ~~Crushed Blocks~~
- Add Sieves
- Add Meshes
- Add Resource Items for Vanilla Ores
- ~~Add Hammers~~
- Add Slik Worms and Infested trees
- Add Crooks

## Building and setting up a development environment
This mod uses [Project Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/) -- an annotation processor that allows us you to generate
constructors, getters and setters using annotations -- to speed up recurring tasks and keep part of our codebase clean
at the same time. Because of this it is advised that you install a plugin for your IDE that supports Project Lombok.
Should you encounter any weird errors concerning missing getter or setter methods, it's probably because your code has
not been processed by Project Lombok's processor. A list of Project Lombok plugins can be found
[here](http://projectlombok.org/download.html).
